This project is a collaboration with the IP Graphical Production & Form program at Yrgo. The assignment was to create an event invitation in the form of a landing page as well as physical printed invitations.

The invitation is for a (fictional) digital exhibition featuring Swedish artist Hilma af Klint's artwork, curated by Göteborgs konstmuseum.

## Code Review :pencil2:

- `index.html:180` - use the semantic element < footer > instead of < section class=“footer” > for better accessibility.
- `index.html: 126 + 139` - use the semantic element < figcaption > instead of < p > when writing a caption for an image.
- great job splitting your css and javascript into separate files. one suggestion is to put your media queries in a separate file also so they are easer to find and read.
- It’s super hard finding anything to comment on! Your code looks great, your site looks amazing and the animations are perfect. Great job!
