This project is a collaboration with the IP Graphical Production & Form program at Yrgo. The assignment was to create an event invitation in the form of a landing page as well as physical printed invitations.

The invitation is for a (fictional) digital exhibition featuring Swedish artist Hilma af Klint's artwork, curated by Göteborgs konstmuseum.
