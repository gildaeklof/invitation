This project is a collaboration with the IP Graphical Production & Form program at Yrgo. The assignment was to create an event invitation in the form of a landing page as well as physical printed invitations.

The invitation is for a (fictional) digital exhibition featuring Swedish artist Hilma af Klint's artwork, curated by Göteborgs konstmuseum.

## Code Review 
- index.html:180 - use the semantic element <footer> instead of <section class=“footer”> for better accessibility. 
- index.html: 126 + 139 - use the semantic element <figcaption> instead of <p> when writing a caption for an image. 
- great job splitting your css and javascript into separate files. one suggestion is to put your media queries in a separate file also so they are easer to find and read. 
- It’s super hard finding anything to comment on! Your code looks great, your site looks amazing and the animations are perfect. Great job!
